# Modeling Practice

This repo holds virtual analog modeling practice problems and minichallenges I made myself to understand different techniques better


## RC Threeways
[link to repo](https://github.com/tgarvs/Circuit-Modelling/tree/main/RC%20ThreeWays)

A plugin that holds a simple RC lowpass filter made with MNA, a DK-Method, and WDF methods. User's can swap between the different techniques to see if they can tell the difference! Users can also adjust the parameters of the resistor and capacitor.

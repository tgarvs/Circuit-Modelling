I am trying to get better at Analog Modeling! But need to practice..alot...This repo holds my experiments as I try to master different modeling techniques and turning them into audio plugins.


## RC Threeways
[link to repo](https://github.com/tgarvs/Circuit-Modelling/tree/main/RC%20ThreeWays)

A plugin that holds a simple RC lowpass filter made with MNA, a DK-Method, and WDF methods. User's can swap between the different techniques to see if they can tell the difference! Users can also adjust the parameters of the resistor and capacitor.
